    "This dataset simply looks at the contract average per year of all MLB players as of 2025. Contract average is a useful metric as it takes into account the full contract value, not just the amount being paid out per year. This accounts for players like Shohei Ohtani, who despite having a 700 million dollar contract, has deferred it and only gets paid 2 million per year. A value like contract average takes this into account, and still shows that he is in fact the highest paid player currently in the MLB. This data was obtained from spotrac.com, looking at their list of MLB Contract Average Rankings list. It was cleaned to just names and salaries, where we then added a categorical description of the salary range for extra clarity."

    "This dataset looks at 3 main batting stats for MLB players, in their + form, which takes into account park factors, since some parks pose advantages based on their weather conditions, but also due to non-standard outfields. These stats are then normalized so that 100 is the league average, meaning any players above 100 are stronger than average, and below are weaker. OBP+ looks at the on-base percentage of a player, to determine how consistently they either walk or hit to get on base. SLG+ looks at the power of their hits, determinig the strength of their at-bats, not just successful hits. Finally, wRC+ looks at runs created for their team, looking at not just things like home runs, but also runs batted in, and even things like sacrifice pop-outs."
