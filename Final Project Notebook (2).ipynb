    "There are a multitude of factors that contribute to what makes a player strong enough to make it to the major leagues of any sport. However, there are many factors that separate out players even once they have made it. In the MLB, there are a multitude of factors that seem capable of being strong predictors of a player. As a player ages, you might expect them to become a weaker player strength wise, but strong mentally. You would expect to see that higher paid players perform better than those on lower contract values. Position played even seems to dictate the strengths of a player. But does the data actually alighn with this? We wanted to analyze a few stats that gave a broad idea of the strength of a player, and compare it to these variables."

    "This dataset simply looks at the contract average per year of all MLB players as of 2025. Contract average is a useful metric as it takes into account the full contract value, not just the amount being paid out per year. This accounts for players like Shohei Ohtani, who despite having a 700 million dollar contract, has deferred it and only gets paid 2 million per year. A value like contract average takes this into account, and still shows that he is in fact the highest paid player currently in the MLB. This data was obtained from spotrac.com, looking at their list of MLB Contract Average Rankings list. It was cleaned to just names and salaries, where we then added a categorical description of the salary range for extra clarity."

These stats are then normalized so that 100 is the league average, meaning any players above 100 are stronger than average, and below are weaker. OBP+ looks at the on-base percentage of a player, to determine how consistently they either walk or hit to get on base. SLG+ looks at the power of their hits, determinig the strength of their at-bats, not just successful hits. Finally, wRC+ looks at runs created for their team, looking at not just things like home runs, but also runs batted in, and even things like sacrifice pop-outs."

This dataset also gives the age of every athlete that was measured.

    "Here we see the average sprint speed for players at each position. The sprint speed stat is calculated in feet per second at the fastest one second burst. In the first graph we are shown that there is very little disparity in sprint speed among the different positions, with catchers being the slowest and center fielders being the fastest. However, we only see a difference of about 2.6 feet per second between these positions. This does not seem to be very significant, however the second graph allows us to see the difference as more apparent than the first. In the second graph we get a more narrow scale of values on the y axis, allowing each average sprint speed to appear further apart. This is useful practically because the differences in sprint speeds is actually more relevant than it may appear strictly on the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between each MLB base is exactly 90 feet, and we know that a runner getting to a base even just a millisecond late determines whether he is safe or out. Because of this, we can picture a player running to a base and realize that a player running 2 feet per second slower than another player, over the course of 90 feet, could cause the player to be multiple feet short of the plate at the time the other team gets the baseball on base to tag the runner out. Even if one runner is only 0.5 feet per second slower than another during their fastest one second burt of speed, the slower runner could easily be one whole foot short of the base when the faster runner has already reached the base and been declared safe. Because Baseball is a game of split seconds that can decide entire seasons, even a small difference in sprint speed can alter a player's running stats and team success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, position played by MLB players does have a significant impact on sprint speed. This is likely due to certain positions requiring different skillsets, some that rely on quickness and some that rely on reaction speed or power. For this reason, players that train to play different positions will naturally be at different levels of quickness when running the bases. "

    "For the most part, this graph proves what we suspected, which was that younger players would be faster than the older players. However, there are 2 outliers. The first one is the 20-year-old age group; we suspect that they are slower because they are so young that they are still working on and developing their strength and speed in order to reach a better average sprint speed. The second outlier is that some 41-year-old players still have a good spring speed; now they aren't the fastest, but for their age, it is pretty good. We believe this is due to them really spending time on taking care of their bodies, so they are able to still run just as fast as some of these younger players."
